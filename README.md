# Sports Leagues

A single-page app that lists all sports leagues with search and sport filter. Clicking a league calls the Season Badge API and shows a season badge image when available. Responses are cached to avoid repeat calls.

## Stack
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- TanStack Query (server-state, caching)

## Run
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
